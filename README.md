# air-pollution-asthma-analysis
Analysis of air pollution and asthma rates in the U.S.

# Objective:
Analyze the relationship between air quality and asthma rates in various regions using public datasets:
1. This data will be useful for examining air pollution levels across different regions in U.S.: https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html
2. This dataset allows us to correlate asthma incidents with air pollution levels across different states in the U.S: https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/nhis/2021/data.htm 

# Steps:
1. Collect and preprocess data from sources like CDC, and EPA.
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends.
3. Perform correlation analysis to assess relationships between pollutants and asthma prevalence.
4. Build predictive models using machine learning techniques such as regression, random forest etc.
5. Visualize findings using QGIS for mapping and Tableau for trend analysis.
